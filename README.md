# Cardiovascular Diseases Risk Prediction

This repository contains a project aimed at predicting the risk of cardiovascular diseases using machine learning models. The dataset used in this project includes various health-related features such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, and more, which are critical for assessing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

## üóÇ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of a person developing cardiovascular diseases based on their health metrics. This project showcases the use of machine learning techniques, data preprocessing, and model evaluation to tackle a healthcare-related classification problem.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following features:
- **Age**: Age of the person.
- **Gender**: Male or Female.
- **Cholesterol**: Cholesterol levels categorized as normal, above normal, or well above normal.
- **Blood Pressure**: Blood pressure levels.
- **Glucose**: Blood glucose levels.
- **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: Body mass index calculated from height and weight.
- **Smoking**: Whether the person smokes or not (0 or 1).
- **Alcohol Intake**: Whether the person consumes alcohol or not (0 or 1).
- **Physical Activity**: Whether the person engages in physical activities (0 or 1).
- **Cardiovascular Disease**: Target variable indicating presence or absence of cardiovascular disease.

## üß† Modeling Approach

The project utilizes various machine learning models to predict cardiovascular disease risk:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the distribution of features and relationships with the target variable.
- **Model Building**: Implementing multiple classification models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

### Model Details:
- **Baseline Model**: Logistic Regression for initial performance benchmark.
- **Advanced Models**: Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Network.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid Search and Random Search for optimal hyperparameters.
